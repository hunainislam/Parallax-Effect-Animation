          At night, the butterfly gracefully flies through the air, drawn to the
          beauty and fragrance of flowers. Its delicate wings flutter gently as
          it glides from one bloom to another, searching for a place to rest.
          The quiet of the night and the soft glow of moonlight add a magical
          touch to its journey. Finally, it finds a vibrant flower to settle on,
          its colors blending with the petals. As it rests, it drinks in the
          nectar, enjoying the calm of the evening. The butterfly's presence
          adds to the peaceful beauty of the night garden, where nature quietly
          comes to life.
