        The elephant is a majestic and powerful animal, known for its large
        size, strength, and intelligence. With thick, gray skin and long, curved
        tusks, it moves gracefully despite its weight. Elephants are social
        creatures, often found in herds, and they share strong bonds with one
        another. Using their trunks, they communicate, gather food, and even
        show affection. Their gentle nature and wisdom make them a cherished
        symbol of loyalty and strength in many cultures.
