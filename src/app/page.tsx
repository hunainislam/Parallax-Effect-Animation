        <h2>Butterfly</h2>
        <p>
          At night, the butterfly gracefully flies through the air, drawn to the
          beauty and fragrance of flowers. Its delicate wings flutter gently as
          it glides from one bloom to another, searching for a place to rest.
          The quiet of the night and the soft glow of moonlight add a magical
          touch to its journey. Finally, it finds a vibrant flower to settle on,
          its colors blending with the petals. As it rests, it drinks in the
          nectar, enjoying the calm of the evening. The butterfly's presence
          adds to the peaceful beauty of the night garden, where nature quietly
          comes to life.

        <h2>Elephant</h2>
        <p>
          The elephant is a majestic and powerful animal, known for its large
          size, strength, and intelligence. With thick, gray skin and long,
          curved tusks, it moves gracefully despite its weight. Elephants are
          social creatures, often found in herds, and they share strong bonds
          with one another. Using their trunks, they communicate, gather food,
          and even show affection. Their gentle nature and wisdom make them a
          cherished symbol of loyalty and strength in many cultures.

        <h2>Heart Of The City</h2>
        <p>
          In the heart of the city, a quiet stream flows under the soft glow of
          streetlights, reflecting the shimmering lights of nearby buildings.
          The water glistens as it winds through the bustling surroundings,
          creating a peaceful contrast to the lively city life. At night, this
          serene sight adds a touch of calm to the city's vibrant energy,
          offering a beautiful moment of tranquility amid the noise and lights.
